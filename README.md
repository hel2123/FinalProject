Description: 
  This is a app for students to use to guide their home compositions. It is assumed they are working with pencil and paper to write a composition on staff paper. They are also responsible for playing through their composition so the instrument should be out and ready as well. Students are familiar with the options provided in this guide and have practice them in classroom assignments.
